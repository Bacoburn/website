               Bringing Better Futures faster
               <br>
               We are a UIC student lead organization who build and race hyperloop pods, to 
               eventually help the world switch to a more clean, faster. 
               safer and reliable mode of transportation. 
               <br>
               Hyperloop, like a maglev train, levitates and uses electromagnets for propulsion, 
               but unlike maglev trains they operate in a vacuum tube to reduce friction, 
               and they operate in smaller "pods" to ensure the most efficient use of the transport device-width
